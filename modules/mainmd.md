# Modules

To make a module, simply fork this repo and add a new entry under the Modules section. However, keep this in mind:

 - Every module *must have it's own subfolder in the modules folder.* This will make the project much more manageable by reducing clashes.
 - Every module *must follow some guidelines.* Ideally, the content should be divided in the following files:
   - 00 Changes: Any changes made to the original system. This should, obviously, be the first thing a player/QM reads.
