Horse PnP Thing introduction

(**or,**)

**In which I talk about my try to make a PnP game from scratch.**

### Reasoning: {#reasoning}

All pony related PnP games are merely modifications of more popular systems, something I want to fix.

### Goals: {#goals}

*   Simplicity, mostly focusing in roleplaying over simulation.
    *   Related to this, all species should be available to the players.
*   Giving a variety of elements for the players to build settings in.
    *   For this reasons, there is no "Canon" setting[^1]-- I will instead give a barebones modules the players can use to build their own, mostly taken from the fandom[^pen].
*   To provide a system that allows for non-violent solutions to conflict[^3], for obvious reasons.


[^1]: Other than _the_ canon setting, of course. Itâ€™ll be a sort of base, and only contain strictly canonical elements.

[^pen]: Proper credit will be given in the manner of abundant footnotes.
