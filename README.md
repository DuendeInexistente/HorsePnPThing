######Horse PnP Thing introduction

######(**or,**)

######**In which I talk about my try to make a P&P game from scratch.**

### Reasoning: {#reasoning}

Originally, my project was to make a P&P game from scratch.
However, it changed pretty quickly-- I decided I'd make the systems setting-agnostic, so that anyone could make a system in any setting.

### Goals: {#goals}

*   Simplicity, mostly focusing in roleplaying over simulation.
    *   Related to this, all species should be available to the players.
*   Giving a variety of elements for the players to build settings in.
    *   For this reasons, there is no "Canon" setting-- I will instead give a barebones modules the players can use to build their own.
*   To provide a system that allows for non-violent solutions to conflict[^home], as not everyone wants to be a slayer of foes.

[^home]: Creatures should have both their stats and methods for non-lethal management.
