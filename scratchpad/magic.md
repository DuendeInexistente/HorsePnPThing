# Magic

Before listing the spells themselves, it's worth noting that not all species cast magic the same way, and there isn't a universal school of magic. Every method has advantages and disadvantages.

Mana burnout bonuses only affect those who suffered the mana burnout due to using a spell with that method.

**Note about classification**: Offensive spells are stat damagers. Defensive spells reduce damage received. Passive spells are invocations or stat restorers/boosters. Miscellaneous spells are their namesake, such as telekinesis or teleportation, even if they can be used offensively or defensively.

**Note about mana burnout stacking**: it doesn't stack over itself. For example, the effects of Arcane Magic mana burnout won't be doubled by the \*2 multiplier.

**Note about the O/D/P/M meters**: it doesn't indicate the POWER LEVEL or something like that, it's just a rough estimate on how well it performs, and how many spells it has, in that area.

#### Arcane Magic

The most classical method, Arcane magic requires no exterior action, making it the faster to cast, but also the most dangerous.

Partial magics
==============

#####(Or, when you make something that uses the magic indirectly)

#### Runecrafting

A school of magic created by zebras during their wars with the griffins. It requires preparation, but can be terribly powerful. Specializes in long-duration spells, such as poison or shields, and has no mana burnout.

Only the base materials are necessary to create them in workbenches, but to make them in the fields Magic has to be used.

stats

#### Gadgetry

While not a magic by itself, it tends to be treated as one.

Gadgetry, as the name indicates, consists on the use of small devices in place of magic, and is sometimes called the earthling runecrafting.

While these gadgets can be crafted with the materials alone at workbenches, mana has to be used to make them in the fields.

Unlike runes, gadgets have instantaneous effects and a chance of ignoring defense. Many gadgets have to be thrown with gloves or via telekinesis, such as metal shards.

-   Can be used by: Everyone

-   Only a limited amount may be crafted every day
-   Up to chrlvl 10, the amount is chrlvl\*2. From then onwards, the ammount is of chrlvl\*1

This effect isn't retroactive, so a chrlvl 10 can craft twenty every day and a chrlvl 11 twenty one.

#### Alchemy

Pioneered by zebras and buffalo, alchemy consists in the destilation of ingredients to produce effects. Potions can be equiped as grenades and thrown, producing their effect in a small area and some kinetic damage. Its effects aren't stackeable by applying the same potion.

#### Cook

Made by everyone far and wide, cooking can be magic on its own. Unlike alchemy, its effects are benign -with the exception of the ability to poison food- and are both long-lasting and stackeable. Only three food pots (four plates each) may be prepared each day.
