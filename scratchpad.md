### Gameplay: {#gameplay}

Mainly around D20, as D100 adds more exactitude than anyone needs in a PnP-- Its little more than masturbating to large numbers. Damage scale would be high-ish, to add flexibility; Starting chars would be at a promedium of 20HP, assuming they aren’t a high/low HP build.

Weapons wouldn’t be grouped by straight class, but by damaging and handling surfaces.

#### Weapons surfaces: {#weapons-surfaces}

May or may not do this; may lead to overcomplexity, a must-not in PnP. Would add flexibility nonetheless. Idea is interesting enough to at least explore; ¿Porque no?

*   Handling surfaces
    *   Small handle <sup>(Swords, daggers)</sup>
    *   Long handle <sup>(Axes, polearms)</sup>
    *   Triggered handle. <sup>(Handguns, crossbows)</sup>

|Pointed end (1d10)|


Damage types

Different damaging surfaces serve nothing with only plain physical damage; Cataloguing is necessary.

*   Physical
    *   Blunt
        *   Closest thing to “Standard” damage, and the preference of those who want to remain non-lethal. Bypasses light armor.
        *   **Crit Succ**: Player can select whether to break a bone of the adversary, or to make them fall unconscious[^9]
    *   Entrapping.
        *   Entrapping weapons, when used as such, can be non damaging
    *   Cutting
        *   Relatively low constant damage, but severe crits.
    *   Puncturing
        *   Relatively high damage output, but harder to handle.

#### Crafting {#crafting}

Due to the flexibility of the weapon categorization system, a crafting system should be easy to implement-- the categorization system could also extend to other things, such as potions and brewing-- It’d be similar to Morrowind’s magic system.

Diferent things that could be crafted

*   Buffing items
    *   Potions would have relatively short, but very intense effects. Overdosing in them would always be a danger, but their effects would stack.
    *   Foodstuffs could be made, with far more lasting -yet non-stacking- effects. Only a limited amount of them could be ingested each day.
*   Debuffing items.
    *   Poisons could be used to coat weapons and projectiles, but making them would be risky-- poisoning, if the maker is unlucky enough and is fooling with very dangerous materials, could be irreversible.
    *   Foods could also be poisoned, optionally.
*   Weapons
    *   All weapons could be turned into their basic components, at the risk of damaging one or several components.

#### Vehicles {#vehicles}

While never as good as a proper lab, carts could carry some of the equipement necesary for certain professions, such as alchemy

[^1]: Other than _the_ canon setting, of course. It’ll be a sort of base, and only contain strictly canonical elements.

[^2]: Proper credit will be given in the manner of abundant footnotes.

[^3]: Creatures should have both their stats and methods for non-lethal management.

[^4]: Can be either normal, sarosian, or crystal.

[^5]: I know they aren’t fucking bovines, don’t remind me. For those who don’t know, goats are crazy fuckers who don’t give no shits about no thing, so they have their own family-- “Caprids”

[^6]: Individuals that are seemingly unique.

[^8]: Weapons that are so massive they require to be driven.

[^9]: Duration of the unconcioussness should be a roll related to **Str**. Maybe turns=[**Str**]d4?
