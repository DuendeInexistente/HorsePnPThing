### Gameplay: {#gameplay}

Mainly around D20, as D100 adds more exactitude than anyone needs in a PnP-- Its little more than masturbating to large numbers. Damage scale would be high-ish, to add flexibility; Starting chars would be at a promedium of 20HP, assuming they aren’t a high/low HP build.

Weapons wouldn’t be grouped by straight class, but by damaging and handling surfaces.

#### Attributes: {#attributes}

Wotdor:

*   **Mental <sup>(Wot)</sup>**
    *   **Wis**dom: Informal knowledge; Street smart; Experience.
    *   **Foc**us: Mental resilience; Ability to concentrate; Tunnel vision/One-track mind.
    *   **Int**elligence: Formal knowledge; Books smart; Empirical teachings.
*   **Physical <sup>(dor)</sup>**
    *   **Dex**terity: Agility; Knowledge of the body; Speed.
    *   **Con**stitution: Stamina; Physical resilience; Resistance to injuries.
    *   **Str**ength: Buffness; Musculature.

#### Weapons surfaces: {#weapons-surfaces}

May or may not do this; may lead to overcomplexity, a must-not in PnP. Would add flexibility nonetheless. Idea is interesting enough to at least explore; ¿Porque no?

*   Handling surfaces
    *   Small handle <sup>(Swords, daggers)</sup>
    *   Long handle <sup>(Axes, polearms)</sup>
    *   Triggered handle. <sup>(Handguns, crossbows)</sup>
    *   Flexible handle <sup>(Bows)</sup>
    *   Telekinetic handle <sup>(Clover</sup>[^siete]
*   Damaging surface
    *   Blunt surface <sup>(A sword’s flat, a club)</sup>
    *   Pointed end <sup>(Sword, spear, arrow)</sup>
    *   Cutting edge. <sup>(Sword, axe)</sup>
    *   Entrapping. <sup>(Whip, rope nets)</sup>
*   Projectile:
    *   Puncturing <sup>(arrow, bullet)</sup>
    *   Burning <sup>(Bullet)</sup>
    *   Debuffing <sup>(Poisoned arrows)</sup>
    *   Cutting <sup>(Shuriken)</sup>
*   Size:
    *   Diminutive <sup>(Bolt, Shuriken)</sup>
    *   Small <sup>(Dagger)</sup>
    *   Medium <sup>(Broadsword)</sup>
    *   Large <sup>(Axe)</sup>
    *   Huge <sup>(Spear)</sup>
    *   Vehicle weapon[^ocho]. <sup>(Canons, battering rams)</sup>

Ejemplo:

| **_Name: Glaive_** | **_Size: Huge_** |

|**_Components: Long handle, cutting flat, Pointed end_**|
|**_Available attacks:_**|
| * Cutting flat (1d5)|
| * Blunt surface (1d2)|
| * Pointed end (1d10)|


Damage types

Different damaging surfaces serve nothing with only plain physical damage; Cataloguing is necessary.

*   Physical
    *   Blunt
        *   Closest thing to “Standard” damage, and the preference of those who want to remain non-lethal. Bypasses light armor.
        *   **Crit Succ**: Player can select whether to break a bone of the adversary, or to make them fall unconscious[^nueve]
    *   Entrapping.
        *   Entrapping weapons, when used as such, can be non damaging
    *   Cutting
        *   Relatively low constant damage, but severe crits.
    *   Puncturing
        *   Relatively high damage output, but harder to handle.

#### Crafting {#crafting}

Due to the flexibility of the weapon categorization system, a crafting system should be easy to implement-- the categorization system could also extend to other things, such as potions and brewing-- It’d be similar to Morrowind’s magic system.

Diferent things that could be crafted

*   Buffing items
    *   Potions would have relatively short, but very intense effects. Overdosing in them would always be a danger, but their effects would stack.
    *   Foodstuffs could be made, with far more lasting -yet non-stacking- effects. Only a limited amount of them could be ingested each day.
*   Debuffing items.
    *   Poisons could be used to coat weapons and projectiles, but making them would be risky-- poisoning, if the maker is unlucky enough and fooling with very dangerous materials, could be irreversible.
    *   Foods could also be poisoned, optionally.
*   Weapons
    *   All weapons could be turned into their basic components, at the risk of damaging one or several components.

#### Vehicles {#vehicles}

While never as good as a proper lab, carts could carry some of the equipement necesary for certain professions, such as alchemy. While practical, they are far too large to enter anything but large spaces such as garages. They'd also be in risk of being stolen.

 *  Gipsy cart: Because everyone will want one if I don't add it. Can store stuff, but it's too large to enter.
 *  Alchemic cart: Allows alchemists to make basic potions.
 *  Medic cart: To carry the wounded safely.


#### Magic {#magic}

Before listing the spells themselves, it's worth noting that not all
species cast magic the same way, and there isn't a universal school of
magic. Every method has advantages and disadvantages.

Mana burnout bonuses only affect those who suffered the mana burnout due
to using a spell with that method.

Note about classification: Offensive spells are stat damagers. Defensive
spells reduce damage received. Passive spells are invocations or stat
restorers/boosters. Miscellaneous spells are their namesake, such as
telekinesis or teleportation, even if they can be used offensively or
defensively.

Note about mana burnout stacking: it doesn't stack over itself. For
example, the effects of Arcane Magic mana burnout won't be doubled by
the \*2 multiplier.

Note about the O/D/P/M meters: it doesn't indicate the POWER LEVEL or
something like that, it's just a rough estimate on how well it performs,
and how many spells it has, in that area.

Pure magics {#h.stnse0c7pa2h .c2 .c19}
===========

(Or, when lights go pew-pew)

#### Arcane Magic {#h.zha06koj95sx .c17 .c2}

The most classical method, Arcane magic requires no exterior action,
making it the faster to cast, but also the most dangerous.

\*2 to all mind magic effects.

#### Cord Magic. {#h.ut957frmsi2v .c2 .c17}

Created by pegasi, this school is all about hit-and-run tactics. It
consists on flying fast enough to create an ethereal chord that can be
manipulated.

#### Kinetic Magic {#h.431v6j55gkn9 .c17 .c2}

Created by minotaurs, kinietic Magic consists of hand movements. It
focuses on kinetic damage and healing, and depends on strenght and
stamina as much as it does in Magic.

#### Weather Magic {#h.7bpzal9owqg4 .c17 .c2}

A magic native to pegasi and griffins which consists in the manipulation
of magically charged vapor, AKA clouds. It's effects can be helpful or
detrimental to other spells.

While moving existing clouds has no cost, creating them has.

Partial magics {#h.rmxru54kq6fs .c2 .c19}
==============

(Or, when you make something that uses the magic indirectly)

#### Runecrafting {#h.m7jiwrccp5zh .c17 .c2}

A school of magic created by zebras during their wars with the griffins.
It requires preparation, but can be terribly powerful. Specializes in
long-duration spells, such as poison or shields, and has no mana
burnout.

Only the base materials are necessary to create them in workbenches, but
to make them in the fields Magic has to be used.

stats

#### Gadgetry {#h.deli2h6a4op1 .c17 .c2}

While not a magic by itself, it tends to be treated as one.

Gadgetry, as the name indicates, consists on the use of small devices in
place of magic, and is sometimes called the earthling runecrafting.

While these gadgets can be crafted with the materials alone at
workbenches, mana has to be used to make them in the fields.

Unlike runes, gadgets have instantaneous effects and a chance of
ignoring defense. Many gadgets have to be thrown with gloves or via
telekinesis, such as metal shards.

-   Can be used by: Everyone

-   Only a limited amount may be crafted every day
-   Up to chrlvl 10, the amount is chrlvl\*2. From then onwards, the
    ammount is of chrlvl\*1

This effect isn't retroactive, so a chrlvl 10 can craft twenty every day
and a chrlvl 11 twenty one.

#### Alchemy {#h.67jz3c4i5q1x .c17 .c2}

Pioneered by zebras and buffalo, alchemy consists in the destilation of
ingredients to produce effects. Potions can be equiped as grenades and
thrown, producing their effect in a small area and some kinetic damage.
Its effects aren't stackeable by applying the same potion.

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

Can be used by: anyone.

#### Cook {#h.inq1i62dztx5 .c17 .c2}

Made by everyone far and wide, cooking can be magic on its own. Unlike
alchemy, its effects are benign -with the exception of the ability to
poison food- and are both long-lasting and stackeable. Only three food
pots (four plates each) may be prepared each day.
