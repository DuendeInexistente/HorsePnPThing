### Gameplay: {#gameplay}

Mainly around D20, as D100 adds more exactitude than anyone needs in a PnP-- Its little more than masturbating to large numbers. Damage scale would be high-ish, to add flexibility; Starting chars would be at a promedium of 20HP, assuming they aren’t a high/low HP build.

Weapons wouldn’t be grouped by straight class, but by damaging and handling surfaces.

#### Weapons surfaces: {#weapons-surfaces}

May or may not do this; may lead to overcomplexity, a must-not in PnP. Would add flexibility nonetheless. Idea is interesting enough to at least explore; ¿Porque no?

*   Handling surfaces
    *   Small handle <sup>(Swords, daggers)</sup>
    *   Long handle <sup>(Axes, polearms)</sup>
    *   Triggered handle. <sup>(Handguns, crossbows)</sup>

| * Cutting flat (1d5)|

Damage types

Different damaging surfaces serve nothing with only plain physical damage; Cataloguing is necessary.

*   Physical
    *   Blunt
        *   Closest thing to “Standard” damage, and the preference of those who want to remain non-lethal. Bypasses light armor.
        *   **Crit Succ**: Player can select whether to break a bone of the adversary, or to make them fall unconscious[^9]
    *   Entrapping.
        *   Entrapping weapons, when used as such, can be non damaging
    *   Cutting
        *   Relatively low constant damage, but severe crits.
    *   Puncturing
        *   Relatively high damage output, but harder to handle.

#### Crafting {#crafting}

Due to the flexibility of the weapon categorization system, a crafting system should be easy to implement-- the categorization system could also extend to other things, such as potions and brewing-- It’d be similar to Morrowind’s magic system.

Diferent things that could be crafted

*   Buffing items
    *   Potions would have relatively short, but very intense effects. Overdosing in them would always be a danger, but their effects would stack.
    *   Foodstuffs could be made, with far more lasting -yet non-stacking- effects. Only a limited amount of them could be ingested each day.
*   Debuffing items.
    *   Poisons could be used to coat weapons and projectiles, but making them would be risky-- poisoning, if the maker is unlucky enough and fooling with very dangerous materials, could be irreversible.
    *   Foods could also be poisoned, optionally.
*   Weapons
    *   All weapons could be turned into their basic components, at the risk of damaging one or several components.

#### Vehicles {#vehicles}

While never as good as a proper lab, carts could carry some of the equipement necesary for certain professions, such as alchemy

[^2]: Proper credit will be given in the manner of abundant footnotes.

[^3]: Creatures should have both their stats and methods for non-lethal management.
